# Introduction

ASearcher is an open-source framework designed for large-scale online reinforcement learning (RL) training of search agents. Our mission is to advance Search Intelligence to expert-level performance. We are fully committed to open-source by releasing model weights, detailed training methodologies, and data synthesis pipelines. Additionally, we provide comprehensive guidance on building and training customized agents based on AReaL. ASearcher empowers developers to build their own high-performance search agents easily and cost-effectively.

**ASearcher Highlights**

+ ⚡ **Fully Asynchronous Agentic RL**: Our scalable agentic RL framework decouples trajectory collection from model training, eliminating GPU idle time and enabling efficient long-horizon RL training.
+ 🌐 **RL Enables Long-Horizon Search**: Through RL training, ASearcher exhibits long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 rounds and generated tokens surpassing 150k during RL training. 
+ 🏆 **Cutting-Edge Performance**: With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher achieves *Avg@4 scores of 58.7, 51.1, and 74.5* on GAIA, xBench-DeepSearch, and Frames, respectively, surpassing other open-source search agents on the same 32B scale. ASearcher achieves *Pass@4 scores of 74.7, 75.0, and 85.5* on GAIA, xBench-DeepSearch, and Frames.

# Results Showcase
We evaluate our approach on challenging QA benchmarks (GAIA, xBench-DeepSearch, and Frames), which test advanced problem-solving abilities and web search strategies. These benchmarks are specifically designed to assess an agent's capability to interact with the real web and retrieve up-to-date information, often beyond the internal knowledge of LLMs.

**Cutting-Edge Performance.** Our agent, [ASearcher-Web-QwQ-v2](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/ASearcher-Web-QwQ), achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source agents, with the highest Avg@4 scores on GAIA and xBench. Additionally, we report Pass@4, which measures the ratio of questions where the agent finds the correct answer within four trials. [ASearcher-Web-QwQ-v2](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/ASearcher-Web-QwQ) also outperforms existing open-source agents in terms of pass rate, further demonstrating its robustness.

**Substantial Improvements Through RL.** When comparing performance before and after reinforcement learning (RL), [ASearcher-Web-QwQ-v2](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/ASearcher-Web-QwQ) achieves improvements of *+15.0, +22.4, and +14.6* on GAIA, xBench-DeepSearch, and Frames, respectively. In terms of pass rate (Pass@4), [ASearcher-Web-QwQ-v2](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/ASearcher-Web-QwQ) also demonstrates significant gains—particularly on xBench-DeepSearch, where it shows a remarkable improvement of 22.4.

# Data Synthesis
We develop a prompt-based LLM agent designed to autonomously generate grounded, challenging, and highly uncertain QA pairs. The process begins with basic questions, which the agent then iteratively refines through two key strategies:

+ Fuzzing: Increasing uncertainty by obscuring key details in the query.
+ Context Injection: Augmenting questions with external facts retrieved via tools to deepen complexity.

Each generated question undergoes rigorous multi-stage validation:

+ Quality Assurance: Checks for fluency, timeliness, and logical coherence.
+ Difficulty Verification: Compares answers generated by an LRM against ground truth to ensure challenge.
+ Answer Uniqueness Validation: Confirms that incorrect LRM answers are indeed invalid, preserving question integrity.

# Fully Asynchronous Agentic RL training

Our analysis reveals significant **variance in the execution time of agent trajectories**. By examining the number of turns and generated tokens during RL training, we observe that lengthy trajectories can require dozens more turns than shorter ones. In terms of token generation, longer trajectories exceed their shorter counterparts by up to two orders of magnitude, as illustrated in the figure below.

![](assets/turns_gen_tokens.png)

<p align="center"> Fig.4 (Left) Number of turns versus training steps. (Right) Number of generated tokens versus training steps. </p>

 
**Fuly Asynchronous RL Training Enables Long-Horizon Tool Use.** In batch-generation RL systems, a batch must wait for the longest trajectory to complete, resulting in significant GPU idle time. In contrast, fully asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) eliminates this bottleneck by completely decoupling training from trajectory generation. This allows relaxed turn limits (e.g., 128 turns/trajectory), enabling agents to explore deeper search paths without sacrificing training efficiency. Remarkably, our agent, ASearcher-Web-QwQ, achieves extreme long-horizon search, **with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and generated tokens surpassing 150k during RL training**.
