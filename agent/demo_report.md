# Final report:

## Section 1: Introduction to Hafnia alvei and Research Context

*Hafnia alvei* is a Gram-negative bacterium of significant interest in both food science and medical research. It is widely distributed in nature and has been identified as a common inhabitant of the digestive tracts of many animal species, including mammals, fish, birds, and insects <cite>17</cite>. In food contexts, *H. alvei* is frequently isolated from various animal-derived products, particularly dairy items such as artisanal cheeses made from cow, sheep, and/or goat milk, as well as from meat and fish products <cite>7, 18</cite>.

This analysis examines three key publications that investigate *H. alvei* from different perspectives: Lagkouvardos et al. (2023) focuses on the bacterium's presence in artisanal Gidotyri cheese; Tapia et al. (2022) provides a comprehensive review of *H. alvei* in food systems; and Déchelotte et al. (2021) reports on a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial investigating *H. alvei*'s potential anti-obesity effects in human subjects <cite>7, 17, 24</cite>. The research scope specifically excludes bibliographic references and concentrates on animal mentions within the main text of each publication to identify commonalities and contextual differences across these diverse research approaches to studying *H. alvei*.

## Section 2: Animal Mentions in Lagkouvardos et al. (2023) on Gidotyri Cheese

The research by Lagkouvardos et al. (2023) on *Hafnia alvei* in Gidotyri cheese mentions several animals in its main text. The primary animal source is the goat, as the study found a tendency for increased prevalence of the Hafniaceae family (to which *H. alvei* belongs) in artisanal cheese samples (Artisanal_CS) where the milk was supplied by different goat farms <cite><id>9</id></cite>. The study's introduction also establishes that artisanal cheeses like Gidotyri are traditionally produced from the milk of cows, sheep, and/or goats, identifying these as potential alternative sources for the cheese matrix in which *H. alvei* was investigated <cite><id>7</id></cite>. Beyond the dairy-producing animals, the paper also mentions mice. Specifically, Table 1, which summarizes the roles of bacterial species, notes that *Hafnia alvei* has demonstrated anti-obesity properties in mice, linking the bacterium's functionality to an animal model outside of its food source context <cite><id>10</id></cite>.

## Section 3: Animal Mentions in Tapia et al. (2022) Review on H. alvei in Foods

The review by Tapia et al. (2022) provides comprehensive coverage of animal associations with *Hafnia alvei*, identifying the bacterium as a common inhabitant of the digestive tracts of many animal species <cite>17</cite>. The authors note that *H. alvei* can act as an opportunistic pathogen in several animal groups, explicitly listing mammals, fish, birds, and insects <cite>17</cite>.

Specific animal sources mentioned include the intestinal microbiota of rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) and the honey bee gut, from which strains with antagonistic properties against pathogens have been isolated <cite>20</cite>. The review also discusses research models used to study *H. alvei*, recommending more studies using complex animals such as zebrafish or mice, or simpler models like the *Galleria mellonella* worm <cite>17</cite>. Notably, the review references studies using obese mouse models to investigate the probiotic properties of *H. alvei* strains <cite>18, 21</cite>.

In food contamination contexts, the review extensively documents *H. alvei*'s presence in various animal-derived products, including meat, fish, seafood (specifically tuna and salmon), and dairy products, particularly cheeses <cite>18, 19</cite>. Table 1 in the review further specifies animal-related strain sources such as cooled raw milk, vacuum-packed fish paste, sea cucumber, vacuum-packed meat, and spoiled turbot <cite>18</cite>. Human health applications are also discussed, including research on human endothelial cells to study anti-inflammatory properties <cite>21</cite>.

## Section 4: Animal Mentions in Déchelotte et al. (2021) Clinical Trial

The 2021 multicenter, randomized, double-blind study by Déchelotte et al. primarily focused on human subjects, involving 236 overweight human participants in a clinical trial investigating *Hafnia alvei* HA4597® supplementation <cite>24, 25</cite>. The study design, participant criteria, and results sections exclusively describe human-specific measurements and clinical parameters, including body weight, BMI, circumferences, and standard human blood parameters <cite>25, 26</cite>.

However, despite the human-centric focus of the clinical trial, the discussion section contains explicit references to animal models. The authors reference their previous preclinical work involving \"mouse models of obesity (HFD-fed and ob/ob hyperphagic mice)\" and mention independent studies on \"food-restricted rats\" <cite>27</cite>. Additionally, the discussion notes that certain human trial results align with \"preclinical findings in obese rodents\" <cite>28</cite>. These animal mentions serve as background context for interpreting the human clinical findings but do not represent subjects within the 2021 study itself.

Thus, while the Déchelotte et al. (2021) clinical trial was conducted exclusively on human participants, it does contain references to mice and rats from prior preclinical research in its discussion section <cite>27, 28</cite>.

## Section 5: Intersection Analysis: Animals Mentioned in All Three Publications

The intersection analysis reveals that only one specific animal is mentioned in the main text of all three publications: the mouse (*Mus musculus*). This consistent mention across disparate research contexts—food microbiology, a comprehensive review, and a human clinical trial—highlights the mouse's established role as a key model organism for investigating *Hafnia alvei*.

In the study by Lagkouvardos et al. (2023) on Gidotyri cheese, *H. alvei* was noted for possessing \"anti-obesity properties in mice\" <summary10>. The review by Tapia et al. (2022) repeatedly references mice, describing research on the probiotic properties of *H. alvei* strains in \"obese mice\" and identifying \"mice\" as a standard model for in vivo studies <summary17>, <summary18>, <summary21>. Finally, the 2021 multicenter clinical trial by Déchelotte et al., while focused on human subjects, grounds its rationale in the \"Discussion\" section by explicitly referencing previous demonstrations of efficacy in \"mouse models of obesity\" <summary27>.

The singular intersection on the mouse underscores a critical translational pathway in *H. alvei* research. Preclinical investigations using mouse models, which explore mechanisms related to obesity and metabolic health, directly inform and provide the scientific basis for subsequent human clinical trials. This pattern demonstrates the model's utility in bridging fundamental research on bacterial properties with applied human health interventions.

------------------------------------------------

# Final answer:

The only animal mentioned in all three publications (Lagkouvardos et al. 2023, Tapia et al. 2022, and Déchelotte et al. 2021) outside of their bibliographies is the **mouse** (*Mus musculus*).

- **Lagkouvardos et al. (2023)** mentions mice in the context of *H. alvei*'s anti-obesity properties.
- **Tapia et al. (2022)** references mice as research models for studying *H. alvei*.
- **Déchelotte et al. (2021)** discusses mouse models of obesity in the discussion section as background for the human clinical trial.

While humans are mentioned in both Tapia et al. (2022) and Déchelotte et al. (2021), they are not mentioned in the main text of Lagkouvardos et al. (2023), making mice the only animal common to all three publications.
