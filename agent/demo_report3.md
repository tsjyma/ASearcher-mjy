# Final report:

## Section 1: Introduction to Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems in Population Axiology

The field of population axiology grapples with the fundamental challenge of ranking populations of different sizes and welfare levels. A central result in this area is Gustaf Arrhenius's impossibility theorems, which demonstrate that no population axiology can satisfy a set of seemingly reasonable adequacy conditions <cite><id>2</id>, <id>4</id></cite>. Arrhenius's work built upon earlier results but sought to present theorems based on much weaker, and therefore less controversial, assumptions <cite><id>2</id></cite>. Among these results, the sixth impossibility theorem plays a key role in highlighting the theoretical difficulties faced by various population ethical theories.

## Section 2: Definition and Principles of Critical-Level Views

Critical-Level Utilitarianism (CLU) is a population axiology developed as a modified version of Total Utilitarianism <cite><id>3</id></cite>. Its core principle redefines the contributive value of an individual's life within a population. Instead of a person's welfare itself contributing to the total value, the contributive value is calculated as the person's welfare level minus a positive, fixed "critical level" <cite><id>3</id></cite>. The overall value of a population is then determined by summing these individual contributive values for every member of the population. A direct consequence of this framework is that lives with positive welfare that is nevertheless below the positive critical level are assigned a negative contributive value <cite><id>3</id></cite>.

## Section 3: The Non-Sadism Condition and its Violation by Critical-Level Views <cite> <id>3</id> </cite>

Critical-Level Utilitarianism (CLU) violates the Non-Sadism Condition, also known as Weak Non-Sadism. This condition states that an addition of any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as an addition of any number of people with negative welfare, other things being equal <cite> <id>3</id> </cite>. However, CLU leads to what are termed "Sadistic Conclusions." Because the contributive value of a life is its welfare minus a positive critical level, lives with positive welfare below this critical level have a negative contributive value. Consequently, CLU can imply that adding lives with negative welfare is better than adding lives with positive welfare <cite> <id>3</id> </cite>.

This violation is demonstrated by a simple example. Suppose the critical level is set at 10 units of welfare (10u). The value of adding a population of 10 people, each with a positive welfare of 5u, is calculated as 10(5 - 10) = -50. In contrast, the value of adding a single person with a negative welfare of -10u is (-10 - 10) = -20. According to CLU's calculation, the addition of the person with negative welfare (-20) is judged to be better than the addition of the ten people with positive welfare (-50), which directly contradicts the Non-Sadism Condition <cite> <id>3</id> </cite>.

## Section 4: Conclusion: Implications for the Sixth Impossibility Theorem

The analysis confirms that Critical-Level Utilitarianism, and by extension critical-level views, violates the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem <cite> <id>3</id> </cite>. This violation is not a minor technicality but strikes at the heart of the theory's normative appeal. By allowing an addition of lives with negative welfare to be judged better than an addition of lives with positive welfare, CLU embraces what Arrhenius terms a "Sadistic Conclusion." This fundamental conflict with a core adequacy condition for population axiologies highlights a significant weakness in critical-level theories, challenging their coherence and ultimate acceptability as solutions to the problem of population ethics. The violation reinforces the power of Arrhenius's theorem by demonstrating that even sophisticated modifications of classical utilitarianism fail to satisfy all our considered moral intuitions.
