# Final report:

## Section 1: Introduction and Key Figures

The accidental discovery of the optical effect that led to the Mirascope involved two key figures at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) around 1969 <cite><id>3</id></cite>. The physicist central to this story is Virgil Elings, who was a young faculty member in the physics department at the time and would later become better known for his pioneering work in scanning probe microscopy. The other essential figure is Caliste Landry, a custodial worker at UCSB whose keen observation initiated the discovery. The historical context is set within the UCSB physics department, which housed a collection of WWII surplus equipment, creating the conditions for this serendipitous event.

## Section 2: The Accidental Discovery

The pivotal discovery of the optical effect occurred serendipitously around 1969. Caliste Landry, a custodial worker at UC Santa Barbara, was cleaning a storage closet in the physics department that contained a collection of carefully stacked WWII surplus searchlight reflectors <cite>3</cite>. These parabolic mirrors were stored in a clamshell fashion. While cleaning, Landry made a curious observation: dust appeared to be "floating" in mid-air at the top hole of one of the reflector assemblies, a phenomenon that "could not be cleaned" <cite>3</cite>. Intrigued by this seemingly impossible occurrence, Landry reported his finding to a young physics faculty member, Virgil Elings <cite>3</cite>.

## Section 3: Optical Principles of the Mirascope <cite><id>3</id></cite>

Following the accidental discovery, Virgil Elings analyzed the optical principles of the two-mirror configuration. The device consists of two parabolic mirrors arranged facing each other. The key to its function is the precise alignment where the focal point of each mirror sits at the vertex of the other. An object placed at the focal point of the bottom mirror emits light that reflects off the top mirror, becoming parallel rays directed downward. These rays then strike the bottom mirror, which reflects them a second time, causing them to converge at the focal point of the top mirror. This convergence creates a real, three-dimensional image that appears to float in the space above the hole in the top mirror, which was the specific optical effect observed by Landry.

## Section 4: Commercialization and Legacy

Following the discovery, Virgil Elings and Caliste Landry were awarded a patent in 1971 for their "Optical Display Device" <summary3>. The commercial rights to the patent were acquired by Opti-Gone International in 1977, which subsequently marketed the device for decades under the name "Mirage" <summary3>. This patent holds particular historical significance as it was Elings' first, preceding his later, more famous work in scanning probe microscopy and the founding of Digital Instruments Inc. <summary3>.

# Final answer:

The physicist was **Virgil Elings**.
