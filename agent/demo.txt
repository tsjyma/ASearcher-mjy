3. **Summary Output for Summary**: Organize into a concise paragraph with logical flow, prioritizing clarity and judge the contribution of the information to the goal.
<summary>

<rationale>The user's goal is to gather foundational information on Dijkstra's algorithm for a report. The provided Wikipedia content is highly relevant as it contains a formal definition, historical context, an explanation of its operation, key properties (including time complexity and limitations), and its applications. The specific sections detailing the algorithm's purpose, its use of a priority queue, its performance, and its common uses directly address the user's request.</rationale>

<evidence>\n**Dijkstra's algorithm** ( [_DYKE-strəz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\")) is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm \"Algorithm\") for finding the [shortest paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem \"Shortest path problem\") between [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) \"Vertex (graph theory)\") in a weighted [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type) \"Graph (abstract data type)\"), which may represent, for example, a [road network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_network \"Road network\")....... \n</evidence>

<summary>Dijkstra's algorithm is a foundational shortest-path algorithm conceived by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, such as a road network. It operates by using a min-priority queue to systematically determine the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes, and it can be terminated early to find a path to a single destination. A key property is its requirement that edge weights be non-negative. Its time complexity is optimized to Θ(|E|+|V|log|V|) using a Fibonacci heap. Common applications include network routing protocols like IS-IS and OSPF, and it serves as a subroutine in other algorithms. The algorithm was famously designed in about twenty minutes without pencil and paper.</summary>

Turn 20 Access
<thought>The current outline is already quite comprehensive, covering all major aspects of Dijkstra's algorithm including definition, historical context, step-by-step operation, implementation details, theoretical foundations, variants, applications, and comparative analysis. The information gathered from Wikipedia and GeeksforGeeks provides solid coverage of these topics.\n\nHowever, the initial search results mentioned a YouTube video that could provide visual explanations, and while the Reddit thread was inaccessible, the YouTube resource might offer valuable visual demonstrations of the algorithm's working process. Since visual explanations can significantly enhance understanding of graph algorithms, accessing this video could provide additional insights for the \"How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works\" section, particularly for the visual example and walkthrough part.\n\nBefore finalizing the outline, I should access this YouTube video to see if it offers any unique visual explanations or demonstrations that could further enrich the report.

Turn 26 Write outline
<thought>The current outline is already comprehensive, but the newly accessed YouTube video (summary10, 11, 12) provides exceptionally clear visual explanations and a step-by-step walkthrough that is highly praised by users. This is a valuable resource that should be integrated to enhance the \"How it Works\" section. I will update Section 2 to explicitly cite this visual source and add a subsection for the visual walkthrough. The key steps from the video's timestamps (marking unvisited, assigning distances, choosing the next node, updating distances) align perfectly with the existing subsections but provide a concrete, visual example to reference. I will cite the relevant YouTube summary IDs (10, 11) in this section to credit this excellent visual resource. No other major structural changes are needed as the outline already covers all critical aspects of the algorithm thoroughly.
