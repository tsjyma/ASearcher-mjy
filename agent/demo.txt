Access (get the content in the webpage)
<access> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnia_(bacterium) <goal> To locate and examine the reference list on the *Hafnia alvei* Wikipedia page, specifically identifying the 2021 article about a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study that is cited there. </goal> </access>

Summary (read the page and summary with goal. Th summary contains 3 parts rationale, evidence and summary)
# More about summary:
1. **Content Scanning for Rational**: Locate the **specific sections/data** directly related to the user's goal within the webpage content
2. **Key Extraction for Evidence**: Identify and extract the **most relevant information** from the content, you never miss any important information, output the **full original context** of the content as far as possible.
3. **Summary Output for Summary**: Organize into a concise paragraph with logical flow, prioritizing clarity and judge the contribution of the information to the goal.

<summary>\n

<rational>\nThe user's goal is to locate a specific 2021 article cited on the *Hafnia alvei* Wikipedia page. The provided webpage content includes the article's main text with embedded citation links (e.g., [[2]], [[3]]), but the full reference list with publication details is not contained within the provided text snippet. The most relevant section is a sentence mentioning the use of *Hafnia alvei* as a probiotic, as this context aligns with a modern clinical trial. The citation link [[2]] and [[3]] in this sentence are the most likely candidates for containing the 2021 study reference.\n</rational>\n

<evidence>\nThe relevant text from the webpage is: \"_Hafnia alvei_ is used as a lactic ferment by the dairy industry and more recently as a **probiotic[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnia_(bacterium)#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnia_(bacterium)#cite_note-3)** included in a dietary supplement product.\"\n</evidence>\n

<summary>\nThe provided Wikipedia page content does not contain the full reference list; it only shows in-text citation links. Based on the context, the mention of *Hafnia alvei*'s recent use as a probiotic, cited by references [[2]] and [[3]], is the most likely location for the 2021 multicenter, randomized, double-blind study article. The full details of the reference (authors, title, journal, etc.) are not available in the given text snippet and would require accessing the complete reference section of the live Wikipedia page.\n</summary>\n

Write (write the report with given summaries)
given: <summary7><rationale>\nThe user's goal is to find animals mentioned in the main text relevant to *Hafnia alvei* research. The provided content from the abstract and introduction directly addresses this. The abstract identifies *Hafnia alvei* as a bacterium found in the cheese samples studied. The introduction defines the source material for these cheeses, explicitly naming the animals whose milk is used. Therefore, the animals are mentioned as the fundamental source of the samples in which *Hafnia alvei* was investigated.\n</rationale>\n<evidence>\nFrom the Abstract:\n\"*Hafnia alvei* (OTU 13) and *Acinetobacter colistiniresistens* (OTU 111) tended to be more prevalent in Artisanal_CS compared to the other two cheese groups (p < 0.10).\"\n\nFrom the Introduction:\n\"artisanal cheeses are generally considered to be hand-made cheeses produced using traditional cheese-making practices from cow, sheep and/or goat milk (preferably raw)...\"\n\"Furthermore, Greece traditionally produces a variety of cheeses from goat milk solely or mixed with sheep milk and/or cow milk...\"\n</evidence>\n<summary>\nThe main text identifies that the research on *Hafnia alvei* was conducted on Gidotyri cheese samples. The introduction specifies that these artisanal cheeses are produced from the milk of cows, sheep, and/or goats. Therefore, the animals relevant to the *Hafnia alvei* research are cows, sheep, and goats, as they are the sources of the milk used to make the cheese studied.</summary>
